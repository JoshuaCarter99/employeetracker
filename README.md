# Employee Tracker

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to use my familiarity with Node, mysql, and schema to create a terminal app that could create a team roster.
- I built this project to display what I have learned about Node, mysql, schema, and .js in accordance with one another.
- The problem solved within the challenge was not building a functioning terminal app from the ground up with using my new found knowledge on schema data.
- I learned how to use schema in accordance with .js!
